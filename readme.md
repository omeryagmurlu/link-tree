# link tree
just a little startpage I've done for my home server, don't bother using on exotic browsers, evergreen (not dead) browsers work
### features
- declarative tree definition: _declare your links in a declarative fashion with categories and conditional logic (mixins) (see `sites.sample.js` for an example)_
- automatic night, light theme support <sup>_amoled black night mode_</sup>
- click to show/hide categories
- iframe aware theming! _(for example when embedding in nextcloud)_
    * _&from query parameter is added as a class to `html` tag_
    * _use it with css_
- fully responsive, mobile first!!!
    * _tree aligns to bottom to ease one-handed-use for example_
- offline first, service worker, stale-while-revalidate!!!!! <sup>_cool stuff_</sup>
- clock !!1!1!!1111!1
- customizable, themeable <sup>_even if it wasn't it's only 200 loc so easy anyways_</sup>

### usage
see `sites.sample.js` for instructions.
